# Emotion-Detection-in-Conversations-using-Attentive-RNN
Emotion detection in conversations is required for a variety of applications, including opinion mining over chat histories, social media threads, disputes, argumentation mining, and interpreting customer feedback in real-time discussions. Currently, systems do not adapt to the speaker of each statement to treat the parties in the discussion independently. We introduce a new method based on recurrent neural networks in this research that keeps track of individual party states during a discussion and uses that knowledge to classify emotions. On two different datasets, our model exceeds the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin.Three gated recurrent units (GRU) Â are used in our proposed DialogueRNN system to mimic these aspects. To update the context and party state, the incoming utterance is fed into two GRUs named global GRU and party GRU. When encoding an utterance, the global GRU encodes appropriate party information.
